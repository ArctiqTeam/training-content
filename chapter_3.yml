        - p: | 
            Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure
            at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems
            listed in Ansible's inventory. This topic covers:
        - ul:
          - Understanding Hosts and Groups
          - Inventory Sources

      -
        - h1: Inventory (continued)
        - ul:
          - hosts
          - groupings
          - inventory-specific data
          - static or dynamic sources
        - class_notes: "Breaking down by topic, we'll cover four parts (Note the listed)"

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Hosts"
        - p: "Things you can do with host entries in Inventory:"
        - ul:
          - Hosts can have host-specific attributes specified for Ansible to use.
          - Things such as static IP addresses, FQDN, alternate SSH ports can be set.
          - Set remote user to ssh as, and what sudo user you want to use per host.
          - Set connection types to the host (Paramiko, OpenSSH, local connection, etc.)
          - --limit allows you to specify only certain host entries to act against
        - class_notes: |
            You have a lot of flexibility when you specify hosts in Inventory. You can
            set variables to determine connection types, host ip addresses and fully-qualified
            domain names, remote users and sudo users as well as any other variable you may 
            come up with to use when interacting with your hosts, such as "apache_port" or 
            "mysql ports".

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Hosts (Continued)"
        - p: "This is an example of a host entry in an inventory file:"
        - code: |
            web1.example.com ansible_ssh_port=5555 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.50
        - class_notes: As you can see, we have a host name, a specified SSH port and IP Address.

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Host Entries Using Ranges."
        - p: "You can have ranges of machine names or letters like this:"
        - code: |
            www[01:50].example.com ansible_ssh_port=5555
            db-[a-f].example.com ansible_ssh_port=5555
        - class_notes: Here we see that we can bracket a range of alpha-numeric characters to shorten our entries in the file.

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Groups"
        - p: "Inventory Host Organization: Groups"
        - ul:
          - Groups allow targeted operations against different types of hosts.
          - Groups can also have variables that apply to all hosts within them.
          - --limit allows you to specify only certain groups to act against
        - class_notes: |
            We can also act against groups of hosts in a similar manner to single hosts.
            This allows you to also have standard settings for lots of similar hosts, such
            as a standard set of ports for apache on all web servers. You can limit the execution of
            Ansible jobs just as you can single hosts with the "--limit" option.

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Groups (Continued)"
        - p: Groups are represented in brackets above host lists in the inventory file.
        - code: |
            [webservers]
            www[01:50].example.com ansible_ssh_port=5555 

      - 
        - h1: Modules and Tasks
        - p: Modules and Tasks are the workhorse of Ansible. This
             topic will cover
        - ul:
          - Understanding what a module is
          - Understanding how tasks make use of modules
