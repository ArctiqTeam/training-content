            Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure
            at the same time. It does this by selecting portions of systems
            listed in Ansible's inventory. This topic covers:
        - ul:
          - Understanding Hosts and Groups
          - Inventory Sources

      -
        - h1: Inventory (continued)
        - ul:
          - hosts
          - groupings
          - inventory-specific data
          - static or dynamic sources
        - class_notes: "Breaking down by topic, we'll cover four parts (Note the listed)""

      -
        - h1: "Inventory: Hosts"
        - p: "Things you can do with host entries in Inventory:"
        - ul:
          - Hosts can have host-specific attributes specified for Ansible to use.
          - Things such as static IP addresses, FQDN, alternate SSH ports can be set.
          - Set remote user to ssh as, and what sudo user you want to use per host.
          - Set connection types to the host (Paramiko, OpenSSH, local connection, etc.)
          - "--limit" allows you to specify only certain host entries to act against
        - class_notes: |
            You have a lot of flexibility when you specify hosts in Inventory. You can
            set variables to determine connection types, host ip addresses and fully-qualified
            domain names, remote users and sudo users as well as any other variable you may 
            come up with to use when interacting with your hosts, such as "apache_port" or 
            "mysql ports".
        - h1: "Inventory Groups"
          - p: "Inventory Host Organization: Groups"
          - ul:
            - Groups allow targeted operations against different types of hosts.
            - Groups can also have variables that apply to all hosts within them.
            - "--limit" allows you to specify only certain groups to act against
            -

        - h1: Modules and Tasks
        - p: Modules and Tasks are the workhorse of Ansible. This
             topic will cover
        - ul:
          - Understanding what a module is
          - Understanding how tasks make use of modules
