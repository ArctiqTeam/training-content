           - class_notes:
             - p: With no additional software infrastructure, you don't have to worry about managing the management tool.
             - p: That means anywhere SSH goes, Ansible goes.
             - p: It doesn't suck memory or CPU resources when it is not in use.
             - p: Designed from day one to automate no-downtime rolling updates and multi-tier orchestration.

           - h2: Secure

           - class_notes:
             - p: It doesn't need additional ports or root level daemons.
             - p: It uses built-in OS authentication for better security - login as who you are, sudo if you want to sudo.
             - p: You can work with tools like Kerberos, LDAP, and sssd.
             - p: OpenSSH is the most peer-reviewed security component around.
             - p: This makes it auditable. You know what you're automating, and bugs have nowhere to hide.
