        - h1: include_vars
        - p: The include_vars module is similar to vars_files and allows for dynamic inclusion of variables within the context of a role. Examples:
        - ul:
          - code: |
            include appropriate vars based on OS
            include_vars: “../vars/{{ansible_os_family}}.yml”

          - code: |
            include_vars: "{{ item }}.yml"
            with_fileglob: "../vars/*.yml"
