          - class_notes: Students will walk through the process Ansible goes through to execute the desired jobs on targeted hosts when a Playbook gets run.

          - p: ...are composed of 1 or more plays...
          - class_notes: Explain the ordering of Plays and the Tasks they contain.

          - p: ...that leverage modules...
          - class_notes: "Show how Tasks leverage a Module to perform an action defined within the Module's code to result in a specified state, based on that module's functions "

        -
          - h2: Modules
          - p: ...that interact with targeted hosts
          - class_notes: Ansible provided modules are Python coded components that interact with a managed node to run the appropriate actions resulting in a specified state defined in the Task.

          - h2: Modules
          - p: "Ansible provided core modules are:"
          - ul:
            - Written in python
            - Are shipped by SSH to the target machine where they are executed
            - Return JSON data that is interpreted by ansible
          - class_notes: Modules can be written in other languages, but core ansible only uses python. We don't need to go into the mechanics of how modules are built before being shipped, just mention that they get copied to the remote machine using SCP/SFTP. The echo out JSON data, which gets interpreted by the ansible "control" machine.
