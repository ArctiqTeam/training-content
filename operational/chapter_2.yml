        - h1: Inventory
        - p: Understand and discuss concepts around managing inventory through static INI formatted files or through dynamic inventory scripts

      -
        - h1: Static INI
        - p: Create an INI inventory file based off of instructor provided servers, specifying a human readable name and a connection IP address or hostname
        - class_notes: We should use a human readable name as the inventory hostname, and specify ansible_ssh_host for the actual IP.  Ungrouped for now.

        - h1: Dynamic Inventory
        - p: What are the use cases for dynamic inventory scripts
        - ul:
          - Limitations of a static inventory with a cloud like environment
          - Query nearly any data source for inventory
          - How ansible knows if the provided inventory is a script
        - class_notes: |
            Using a static inventory file with a "living" cloud like environment is inefficient, error prone and difficult to maintain.

            Due to the nature of an inventory script, they can mostly leverage the full power of the language they are implemented in. This would enable the script to communicate with nearly any data source for use as inventory.

            Ansible determines if the provided inventory is a script, by checking if the file is executable.  If the file is not executable it is parsed as an INI file.
