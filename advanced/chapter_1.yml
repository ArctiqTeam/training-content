        - class_notes: |
            Configuration files accept configuration directives to modify
            the way Ansible runs, for example: configuring a specific 
            connection type, or to set the number of forks.

          - "ansible.cfg (in the current directory)"

          - "/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg"
        - class_notes: |
            These are the three locations where configuration files are kept.
            The configuration files in these locations are read and evaluated
            in an order of precedence.  The system file in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
            has the lowest precedence, the "~/.ansible.cfg" is next highest, and
            "./ansible.cfg" is the highest precedence.

            Environment variables have the highest precedence of all, and work similarly
            to configuration directives in config files
