        - ul:
            - Executable script
            - Queries a service that holds data about servers
            - Returns the data to Ansible (as JSON)

            Dynamic inventory is a script that queries a service, like a cloud
            provider API or a management application like Spacewalk.  This data
            is formatted in an Ansible-specific JSON data structure and is used in 
            lieu of hardcoded, static inventory files.

            - Time
            - Accuracy
        - class_notes: |
            Ideally, the source of data for our dynamic inventory scripts is 100%
            correct, and is automatically updated as infrastructure changes.  This 
            is especially useful in environments where machines are coming on and offline
            all the time, like a cloud or virtual environment.

        - h3: Manual Invocation
        - code: |
            
            $ ./docker.py --list

            Manual invocation of a dynamic inventory script is fairly straight forward.
            Dynamic inventory scripts must be executable, so calling them explictly will
            invoke the script and return JSON as output.
